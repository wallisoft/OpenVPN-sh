# OpenVPN-sh.sh
Adds shell script icon to favourites to connect/disconnect linux OpenVPN client 

Simple bash script to start/stop OpenVPN. 
Right click icon to browse for *.ovpn profile

Added an installation script containing an embedded tarfile with all files. Run as a non priveliged user to add application icon to your favorites and autostart connection at boot.

Currently only works for Gnu Desktop and only tested on ubuntu 20.04 but should be fine for any gnu desktop.
